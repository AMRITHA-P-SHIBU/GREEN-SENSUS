Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making 
A project for NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2024

**GREEN SENSUS -**
Green Sensus is a beginner-friendly web application designed to help farmers and gardeners make data-driven agricultural decisions.
We built this project as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 hosted at Amal Jyothi College of Engineering (Autonomous), Kanjirappilly.

Our goal was to explore how Earth Observation Data can be used to support sustainable agriculture by providing real-time analysis tools — all in one simple, accessible web platform.

**Features -**
🔹 Weed Analysis to analyze plant health and detect weed stress visually,
🔹 Water Footprint Calculator to estimate and manage water consumption efficiently,
🔹 Climate Analysis to understand climate factors influencing crop productivity and an
🔹 About Section to learn more about the Green Sensus initiative.

🛠️ Built With
HTML5 for structure,
CSS3 for styling and responsive design,
Figma for UI/UX design mockups and
GitHub Pages / Vercel for deployment.

💡 Our Learning Journey
This was our first-ever hackathon, and we learned how to:
Collaborate effectively as a team
Use GitHub for version control and project hosting
Convert design prototypes into functional code
Present a working prototype under time constraints
It was challenging, fun, and a truly rewarding galactic experience! 🚀✨
